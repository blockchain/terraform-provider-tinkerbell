# test directory

This directory contains modified version of [sandbox](https://github.com/tinkerbell/sandbox)
code, which allows to run `tinc-server` locally in a Docker container using `docker-compose`,
which allows running acceptance tests.

Created setup is not a functional Tink setup, but only an API and the database, which is sufficient
to run tests.
